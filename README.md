# pandas-challenge
A project analyzing district-wide standardized test results using pandas

PyCitySchools_starter is a jupyter notebook file containing calculations, summaries, and counts for schools, students, budgets, math scores and reading scores.

A DataFrame was created merging two csv files for school data and student data on the common series "School Name".  A School District summary was completed and a snapshot DataFrame was created from the calculations for number of schools, number of students, total budget for all schools, average math and reading scores for all schools, and percentages for passing reading and math scores.

A second Data Frame was completed for the summary of each school, which included the calculations for number of students, school budget, per capita spending, average test scores, number of passing math and reading scores, number of students who passed both math and reading, and the passing rates for math, reading, and overall passing.

This project isn't completed yet but it will include the highest and lowest performing schools by percentage, math and reading scores by grade, scores by budget, and scores by school size and type.
